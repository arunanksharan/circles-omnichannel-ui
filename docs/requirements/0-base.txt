ultrathink and Approach this exactly like a **production-grade demo UI** that a senior Next.js engineer would build to *tell the story clearly* to stakeholders and engineers.

Use:

 Nextjs for frontend web portal, client portal, candidate portal and any other portal/webapp you can think of. We can choose to keep all these as separate products - with typescript, zustand, tailwind css, react tanstack query, next-auth

You can analyse the following dependencies and see what is needed and can be used for buttery smooth and awesome UI/UX
Analyse the dependencies and explain what each do.
I am looking for awesome templates for landing pages and web portal I can use directly for nextjs/reactjs setup
Be ready to build Stripe-level animated hero sections or Apple Vision Pro demo-tier visuals.

I’ll do this in **two steps**, as you asked:

---

# 1️⃣ What the **right-side** should represent (Circles.co omnichannel demo)

### Mental model for the demo UI

The **left side** already represents:

> **“Circles Telecom App (User-facing events & support)”**

So the **right side** should represent:

> **“Circles.co Omnichannel Intelligence Layer (How Circles sees the user across channels)”**

This contrast is extremely powerful in demos.

---

## ✅ Recommended right-side layout

### Title

**Circles.co – Omnichannel Context View**

### Sections on the right side (top → bottom)

---

### **A. Unified User Context (Read-only, derived)**

Shows *what Circles “knows” about the user after ingesting all channels*.

This demonstrates:

* Identity resolution
* Cross-channel memory
* Temporal correctness

Fields:

* Unified User ID
* Active Mobile Number(s)
* Current Plan
* Current Location (derived)
* Recent Activity Summary

---

### **B. Channel Timeline (Multi-channel events)**

Shows how data arrived from **different channels**.

Channels to demo:

* 📱 App Transaction (SIM / Top-up)
* 💬 In-App Support Chat
* 📞 Voice Call (future / optional)
* 🌐 Web Session (future / optional)

Each entry shows:

* Channel
* Timestamp
* Event type
* Linked conversation / transaction ID

This visually reinforces *omnichannel*.

---

### **C. Active Issues & Sentiment**

Shows what is **currently unresolved**.

Fields:

* Open Issue Type (e.g. International Roaming)
* Issue Age
* Sentiment Trend
* Escalation Risk

This is gold for Circles stakeholders.

---

### **D. Memory Projection (What the AI sees)**

This is optional but very powerful.

A readonly text block:

> “This is the context injected into the AI for the next interaction.”

This makes the system tangible.

---

## Why this right-side works

* It **does not repeat raw input**
* It shows **derived intelligence**
* It demonstrates **cross-channel stitching**
* It makes memory visible without creepiness

---

# 2️⃣ Actual data samples (ready to paste into the UI)

Now let’s design **exact data** for your two input fields.

---

## 🔹 LEFT SIDE — Input Field 1

### **SIM Card / Mobile Transaction (Process JSON)**

```json
{
  "event_type": "SIM_TOP_UP",
  "user_id": "usr_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "mobile_number": "+6591234567",
  "transaction_id": "txn_9f1c2b7e-3c41-4e21-9b71-2d4a6a91f112",
  "top_up_amount_sgd": 20,
  "top_up_method": "Credit Card",
  "transaction_timestamp": "2026-01-14T10:42:00+08:00",
  "app_channel": "circles_mobile_app",
  "country": "Singapore",
  "metadata": {
    "currency": "SGD",
    "promo_applied": false,
    "roaming_pack_active": true
  }
}
```

### What this demonstrates

* Transactional data
* Non-conversational channel
* Authoritative business event
* Identity anchor via mobile number

---

## 🔹 LEFT SIDE — Input Field 2

### **Support Chat Conversation (Free text + metadata)**

### Free text conversation (textarea)

```
Agent: Hi, welcome to Circles support. How can I help you today?
User: Hi, my international roaming is not working.
Agent: Sorry to hear that. Which country are you currently in?
User: I am in Japan right now.
Agent: Thanks. Have you already enabled roaming from the app?
User: Yes, I enabled it yesterday but I still have no signal.
Agent: Understood. Let me check this for you.
User: This is really frustrating, I need connectivity urgently.
```

### Metadata below the textarea

```json
{
  "user_id": "usr_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "conversation_id": "conv_3a7d91c2-98f4-4a6b-bd91-84a6f20c112b",
  "channel": "in_app_support_chat",
  "conversation_start": "2026-01-14T11:05:00+08:00",
  "conversation_end": "2026-01-14T11:18:00+08:00"
}
```

### What this demonstrates

* Unstructured conversational data
* Emotional signal (“frustrating”)
* Location change (Japan)
* Issue type (International Roaming)
* Channel-specific interaction

---

## 🔹 RIGHT SIDE — Example derived output (read-only)

This is what your demo UI should *show* after backend processing.

### **Unified User Context**

```json
{
  "unified_user_id": "usr_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "primary_mobile_number": "+6591234567",
  "current_country": "Japan",
  "home_market": "Singapore",
  "active_plan": "Circles One",
  "roaming_enabled": true,
  "last_transaction": {
    "type": "SIM_TOP_UP",
    "amount_sgd": 20,
    "timestamp": "2026-01-14T10:42:00+08:00"
  }
}
```

---

### **Channel Timeline**

```json
[
  {
    "channel": "Mobile App",
    "event": "SIM Top-Up",
    "reference_id": "txn_9f1c2b7e-3c41-4e21-9b71-2d4a6a91f112",
    "timestamp": "2026-01-14T10:42:00+08:00"
  },
  {
    "channel": "In-App Support Chat",
    "event": "Roaming Issue Raised",
    "reference_id": "conv_3a7d91c2-98f4-4a6b-bd91-84a6f20c112b",
    "timestamp": "2026-01-14T11:05:00+08:00"
  }
]
```

---

### **Active Issues & Sentiment**

```json
{
  "open_issue": "International Roaming Not Connecting",
  "issue_age_minutes": 13,
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "frustration_level": "High",
  "escalation_risk": "Medium"
}
```

---

### **AI Memory Projection (Optional, powerful)**

```
User is currently in Japan and has an active roaming pack.
They recently topped up their SIM card.
They are experiencing an unresolved international roaming issue and are frustrated.
Respond concisely and prioritize resolution.
```

---

# Why this demo UI will land well

* Clean separation of **raw input vs derived intelligence**
* Clear omnichannel story
* Extremely intuitive for non-technical stakeholders
* Very easy to extend with Voice / Web later
* Shows *why* memory matters, not just *that* it exists

Perfect — now we’re anchoring the **UI to Graphiti as the source of truth**, not just “memory vibes”. I’ll do this in **three crisp parts**:

1. **How the UI should look when Graphiti is the authority**
2. **Rewritten UI description (left vs right, Graphiti-aware)**
3. **Reworked data samples (what goes into Graphiti, what comes out)**

I’ll be very explicit about **what is fact vs episode vs derived**, because that’s what most demos get wrong.

---

# 1️⃣ How this UI should look *with Graphiti in mind*

When Graphiti is in the picture, the UI **must visually teach one idea**:

> **Raw omnichannel inputs → Temporal facts → Current truth**

So the UI must **separate ingestion from state**.

### ❌ What we must avoid

* Showing Mem0 outputs as “facts”
* Showing vector memory as “current”
* Showing chat transcripts as authoritative

### ✅ What we must show

* “This is what was said”
* “This is what became true”
* “This is what is true *now*”

That’s the Graphiti story.

---

# 2️⃣ Revised UI description (Graphiti-first)

## Overall layout (still vertical split)

### Left: **Circles Telecom App (Omnichannel Ingestion)**

> *What events and conversations happened*

### Right: **Circles.co – Graphiti Context Engine**

> *What Circles now knows to be true*

This wording matters. Stakeholders immediately understand authority.

---

## LEFT SIDE (unchanged structure, clarified meaning)

### 🔹 Title

**Circles Telecom App – User Activity & Support Channels**

---

### 🔹 Section A: Business Event (Authoritative Signal)

#### Label

**Mobile Network Event (Structured / Deterministic)**

> “This is a factual system event. It may directly update user state.”

#### Input 1: Process JSON (SIM / Network / Billing)

```json
{
  "event_type": "SIM_TOP_UP",
  "user_id": "usr_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "msisdn": "+6591234567",
  "transaction_id": "txn_9f1c2b7e-3c41-4e21-9b71-2d4a6a91f112",
  "amount": 20,
  "currency": "SGD",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-14T10:42:00+08:00",
  "source_system": "circles_bss",
  "network_flags": {
    "roaming_pack_active": true
  }
}
```

**Graphiti implication**
➡️ This may update **billing state** but **does NOT create user facts** like “location”.

---

### 🔹 Section B: Support Conversation (Unstructured / Episodic)

#### Label

**Customer Support Interaction (Conversational / Interpretive)**

> “This is what the user said. Facts must be inferred and validated.”

#### Input 2: Free-text chat transcript

```
Agent: Hi, welcome to Circles support. How can I help?
User: My international roaming is not working.
Agent: Which country are you currently in?
User: I am in Japan.
Agent: Have you enabled roaming?
User: Yes, since yesterday. Still no signal.
User: This is really frustrating.
```

#### Metadata (below textarea)

```json
{
  "user_id": "usr_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "conversation_id": "conv_3a7d91c2-98f4-4a6b-bd91-84a6f20c112b",
  "channel": "in_app_support_chat",
  "started_at": "2026-01-14T11:05:00+08:00",
  "ended_at": "2026-01-14T11:18:00+08:00"
}
```

**Graphiti implication**
➡️ This creates:

* episodic records
* candidate facts
* emotional signals
  but **no truth yet**.

---

# 3️⃣ RIGHT SIDE – Graphiti-aware view (this is the key rewrite)

## 🔹 Title

**Circles.co – Graphiti Temporal Context (Authoritative View)**

Subtitle:

> “Current user state after resolving all channels and history”

---

## 🔹 Section 1: Current Authoritative User State (Graph Snapshot)

This section **only shows facts with a `valid_to = null` edge**.

### Label

**Current State (as of now)**

```json
{
  "user_id": "usr_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "home_market": "Singapore",
  "current_country": "Japan",
  "active_msisdn": "+6591234567",
  "roaming_status": "Enabled",
  "open_support_issue": "International Roaming Not Connecting"
}
```

📌 UI detail:

* Small badge: `SOURCE: Graphiti`
* Timestamp: `resolved_at: 2026-01-14T11:20`

This subtly teaches **authority**.

---

## 🔹 Section 2: Temporal Fact History (Why this is true)

This section demonstrates **Graphiti’s real power**.

### Label

**Temporal History (Resolved Facts)**

```json
[
  {
    "fact": "USER_IN_COUNTRY",
    "value": "Japan",
    "valid_from": "2026-01-14T11:06:00+08:00",
    "derived_from": "support_chat"
  }
]
```

UI hint:

> “Older facts are retained but not active.”

This shows **bi-temporal reasoning without jargon**.

---

## 🔹 Section 3: Episodic Signals (Not Truth)

This is where Mem0/vector memory is **demoted properly**.

### Label

**Recent Episodes & Signals (Non-authoritative)**

```json
[
  {
    "type": "support_episode",
    "summary": "User reported roaming not working while in Japan",
    "conversation_id": "conv_3a7d91c2-98f4-4a6b-bd91-84a6f20c112b",
    "importance": "high"
  },
  {
    "type": "sentiment_signal",
    "signal": "Frustration detected",
    "confidence": 0.81
  }
]
```

UI hint:

> “Used to inform tone and prioritization.”

This prevents misinterpretation.

---

## 🔹 Section 4: AI Context Projection (What the bot sees)

This is the **money shot** for demos.

### Label

**Injected AI Context (Read-only)**

```
User is currently in Japan with roaming enabled.
They recently topped up their SIM card.
There is an unresolved roaming connectivity issue.
User sentiment indicates frustration.
Respond concisely and focus on resolution.
```

📌 Important:

* This is **derived**
* This is **not stored**
* This is **recomputed per interaction**

---

# 4️⃣ Why this revised UI is Graphiti-correct

### It makes these invariants visible:

| Principle              | Shown in UI             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Single source of truth | “Current State” section |
| Temporal resolution    | History section         |
| Mem0 ≠ truth           | Episodic signals        |
| Omnichannel stitching  | Channel-derived facts   |
| Voice safety           | Precomputed context     |

---

# 5️⃣ What this fixes vs the previous version

### Before

* Looked like “smart memory”
* Risked dual truth
* Mem0 felt authoritative

### Now

* Graphiti is visibly authoritative
* Memory vs fact is obvious
* Stakeholders *see* why Graphiti exists

---

## Final verdict

This revised UI:

* Correctly reflects Graphiti semantics
* Teaches omnichannel resolution visually
* Avoids every common demo mistake
* Is exactly how I’d demo this to a telco CTO
